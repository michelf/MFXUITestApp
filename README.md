MFXUI Test Application
======================

Xcode project for testing [MFXUI](https://github.com/michelf/MFXUI).


Using for development
---------------------

The easiest way to use this project alongside a development version of the MFXUI package is to create a workspace in Xcode and add both the MFXUI package and the MFXUITestApp project file to the workspace. Xcode will prefer the version that was directly added to the workspace and use it instead of the one in the public repository.
